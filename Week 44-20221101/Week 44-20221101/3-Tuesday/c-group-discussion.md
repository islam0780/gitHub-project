- The pros and cons of Top-down and bottom-up strategies?
//
While a bottom-up approach allows decisions to be made by the same people who are working directly on a project, the top-down style of management creates distance between that team and decision-makers. This can lead to poorly-informed decisions if leadership doesn't ask for input or feedback from their project team.

- How is require() different from import()?
//One of the major differences between require() and import() is that require() can be called from anywhere inside the program whereas import() cannot be called conditionally, it always runs at the beginning of the file.

- How do you define custom scripts in `package.json`?
// npm run test
- Explain the HTTP Request / Response cycle.
